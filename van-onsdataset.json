If someone calls because they want to build a new website, check if one of the Project Managers is around to take over the conversation. If not, ask the person to send an email to a Project Manager, preferably with a briefing. 4. Always stay nice, don't lose your patience, and don't forget: 'leave emotion at the door'."
